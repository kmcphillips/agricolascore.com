## Goals

This is a site designed for mobile browsers to be used as a score coard for the board game [Agricola](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola).

I'm using this site to design a web application, specifically for mobile, using jQuery Mobile. 


## Thanks

I started off with the simple Sinatra HTML5 boiler plate:

That was based off the amazing work of the HTML5 boiler plate team:
